              Hi! I´m Elizabeth Ita, I´m currently 22years old, and I´m about to
              turn 23 next november, and to be more specific, the 21st, I had
              the pleasure to experience what is like to be a flight attendant
              for about 2 years straight, I explored tons of new places all
              around the world, but for sure, my favorite place on Earth, New
              York City. Currently I´m working as a Full-Stack Engineer, well,
              I´m still learning everything about it, but in fact, I´m in love
              with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was born and raised in Mexico City, but I had the opportunity to
              live around Mexico, I´ve lived in Mexico city, Pachuca de Soto,
              Guadalajara and also in Miami, but all of this places have a huge
              piece of my heart, For sure I really enjoy being everywhere, ´cuz
              every single hidden place in this world, is gorgeous, and holds
              tons and tons of memories, adventures and lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              I really enjoy all kinds of music, but my favorite artist of all
              time is the gorgeous and unique Ariana Grande, and lately I´ve
              been obssesed with one of here songs thats called "Safety Net",
              you should definitely check it out, you won´t regret it at all.
            </p>
